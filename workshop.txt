title=B42.1 Plumbing Fix
description=42.2.0 status update - confirmed working with added tests for stability.
description=
description=NOTE: For B42 only. If you are running the stable branch (b41) and/or havent opted into any betas, then this mod will not work and will probably break existing functionality.
description=
description=This mod restores b41 plumbing functionality for b42 using the new fluid systems including mixed fluids.
description=
description=FAQ:
description=> Can you make the rain barrels fill when i'm not back at base?
description=I made a separate mod for this that is compatible with this one: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3413993204
description=
description=> Is this compatible with mod X?
description=Probably not. Any existing mod that interacts with water objects will be using the old fluid system, and my mod converts everything to the new system. It's likely that those mods will require a large overhaul when the fluid system changes go in, so you may be able to convince the author to try to make it compatible (or partially) with mine. Skyblue made a mod that reintroduces the old rain barrels for plumbing, so that mod might be better if you're looking for mod compatibility.

description=> How to use mod?
description=1. Find sink
description=2. Wait for water outage
description=3. Build/place a rain collector barrel or crate in one of the tiles in the 3x3 grid directly above the sink, or in the 3x3 grid around the first outdoor tile found directly above the sink.
description=4. Right click sink -> Plumb Sink
description=5. Wait for rain.
description=6. Right click sink -> show info to see Fluids UI panel showing the water flowing from barrel to sink.
description=
description=Recreated Features/Requirements (same as vanilla)
description=> Placement of collector barrel should be 1 floor above the sink, either directly above or 1 tile away from that.
description=> Requires an equipped pipe wrench to plumb
description=> Water must be shut off
description=> Can fill water containers or drink from plumbed sinks
description=> Water from plumbed sinks is purified
description=> Fill / Wash / Drink context options work with new fluid containers
description=
description=New Features (New in b42 version)
description=> Now searches higher! Skyscrapers, basements, and sinks in building interiors generally can now be plumbed.
description=> Plumbing sinks creates a new fluid container object and attaches it to the sink
description=> If you have a pipe wrench equipped, but no barrels placed, you can activate the placement helper by right clicking the sink to create temporary holograms on the roof to help you determine proper barrel placement.
description=> Sinks automatically connect to all barrels that the sink can reach, so once plumbed you can add barrels or move barrels if needed without replumbing.
description=> You can have multiple sinks per barrel or multiple barrels per sink as long as the placement is valid.
description=> Attached collectors drain into plumbed sinks at an even rate. Use this to your advantage to make fluid mixtures with specific proportions.
description=> New Show Info / Transfer Liquids UI works and updates in realtime when refilling from plumbed containers
description=> If you have a pipe wrench, you can see the Plumb option pre-water shutoff to convert containers to the new fluid system, but they will need barrels to refill after the water goes out.
description=> New collector search method looks at the 3x3 grid above the sink (like normal, but includes indoor tiles). If no rain collectors are found, it searches upwards for the first outside square then searches a 3x3 grid around that square for collectors.
description=> Properly transfers mixed fluids, so now you can finally have the soda, whiskey, tea and/or milk sink you've always wanted.
description=> Showers can now be plumbed, they are equivalent to baths but 1 tile.
description=> Combo washing machine + Dryer now automatically starts a dryer cycle once the wash cycle finishes.
description=> Washing with non-water or blood makes items dirty and washing with blood makes items bloody. Washing with water works like normal.
description=> Baths/Showers are the only plumbable containers with infinite capacity for washing yourself/clothes in 1 action, this way washing yourself/clothes is discouraged in sinks and encouraged in baths/showers. It's still possible via the sink, but will require more manual actions as it fills.
description=> Tabletop dispensers can be enabled by right clicking. This will give them a fluid container, mostly for the purpose of adding variety to your portable dispenser options alongside the regular water dispenser, and giving an appropriate storage location for readily-used drinks.
description=
description=Known Issues/limitations:
description=> For optimization reasons, it only updates when you check the sink, so you won't see your barrel drain immediately until you go check the sink.
description=> Drinking non-water liquids directly from the sink/shower/tub still behaves like drinking water (Vanilla b42 issue)
description=> Pre-plumbing washing machines cant clean rags (Vanilla b42 issue)
description=> Drink context menu option always appear regardless of thirst (Vanilla b42 issue)
description=
description=Here's some things I would like to add, or would like to see added, to the plumbing system. I'm curious if anyone has any feedback on these ideas or has any additional ideas. I'm not currently planning on adding them to the mod because they are a departure from vanilla and the entire system is subject to change.
description=
description=plumbing expansion ideas:
description=> skill requirement: mostly tied to barrels so maybe unnecessary, but maybe like carpentry 1-2 for cases where you scavenge a barrel
description=> pipe item requirement: require Z pipes where Z is how high the collector is above the sink (when plumbing sink)
description=> adhesive item requirement: require Z-1 adhesive units where Z is how high the collector is above the sink
description=> plumb collectors requirement: require 1 pipe to connect the collector to the water system
description=> water filter item requirement: require water filter item to enable filtration of purified water
description=> water filter skill requirement: require ? skill level to apply water filter to plumbed sink
description=> water filter uses: water filter is used up after X units of water filtered
description=> Uses for a full/partially full sink/bath - give reason to run sink/bath and fill for washing or other purposes? Would probably require a rework of washing mechanics.
description=> Horizontal piping: add buildable pipe that can connect sinks on the same level, and eventually, sprinklers? (don't say I didn't suggest anything nice)
